# Plugin limitations

- **requires additional HW** (laser pointer device, projector)
- **requires crossed polarised filters to work**
- might work with monitor / TV screen but **not recommended** since you will be exposing pixels to a very **strong laser beam**.
- **keep sun light to a minimum** since it will affect laser detection
- works only with **red laser pointer** (visible light spectrum).
- currently supports **only one input** i. e. multiple laser dots will count as one.
- uses gpu for image processing.
- tested with UI elements of type button, checkbox, toggle. Other might / might not work.
- accuracy is **relative** i. e. for best accuracy place camera accordingly.
- at the moment, does not persist between scenes
